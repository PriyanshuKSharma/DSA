Queue

Four types of queues
1 Simple or linear
2 Circular
3 Enqueue
4 Double ended


		1Simple or Linear Queue

Rear = Max_size - 1
We cannot insert value in the simple queue if the rear = Max_size-1

		2Circular Queue

A circular queue is a type of queue where the front and rear pointers wrap around
when they reach the end of the queue. This allows for efficient use of space in cases where a queue can
overflow.

Why was the concept of the circular queue introduced?
There was one limitation in the array implementation of Queue. If the rear reaches to the end position of the Queue
then there might be possibility that some vacant spaces are left in the beginning wich cannot be utilized. So, to overcome
such limitations, the concept of circular queue was invented.

		3Enqueue
		#Algorithm for enqueue
1st Condn:
if
	F=0
	R=Max_size-1
	print(queue is full)

2nd Condn:
if
	F=-1
	R=-1

set
	F=0
	R=0

else
	R=R+1
	insert

		Algorithm for inserting an element
There are two scenarios in which queue is not full
1> rear!=max-1
2> front!=0 and rear=max-1

There are two scenarios in which element cannot be inserted
1>front==0 and rear=max-1
2>front==rear+1
